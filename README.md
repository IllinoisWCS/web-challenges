# Web Part I Challenges

We've provided 2 files:
- index.html - this is where all of your HTML code will go
- style.css - add your CSS styling here

Note: We will be adding Javascript snippets in the HTML. This is normally not the practice.

You'll need:
- A web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)
- A text editor, preferably with syntax highlighting (Notepad++, Sublime Text, Atom)

These files include the example solutions but allow for you to figure out the solutions for the challenges.
